/**
 * Extbase 6.1+ bugfix with use of the deprecatedPropertyMapper.
 *
 * In 6.1, the update-mechanism is more aligned to that of FLOW,
 * which works great for the rewrittenPropertyMapper, which is the
 * default in this version. However, it no longer works for the
 * deprecatedPropertyMapper. Since the deprecatedPropertyMapper is
 * still functional until 6.3 and I have to maintain compatibility
 * with 4.5-6.2, I use it in several extensions until I get to
 * rewriting my form-handling for 6.x exclusively.
 *
 * The bug is that the update() method checks if the object exists
 * based on the spl_object_hash. However, spl_object_hash() returns
 * only the same hash if the object-instance is one and the same.
 * With the deprecatedPropertyMapper, this is never the case: the
 * one set in the objectMap is instantiated seperately from the one
 * that is mapped to the controller and eventually passed by
 * update()'s argument.
 *
 * My "fix" is just an implementation similar to pre-6.1, but only
 * if the condition-check of the rewrittenPropertyMapper fails.
